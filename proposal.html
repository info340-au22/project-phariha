                It has come to our attention that underclassmen (freshman and sophomore students) lack the general understanding of how majors and minors function at the University of Washington. This especially pertains to undeclared students that are trying to identify the prerequisite courses needed for an application. Though these resources are already available online, students struggle locating all this information as it only exists on the major department website.
