            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                It has come to our attention that underclassmen (freshman and sophomore students) lack the general
                understanding of how majors and minors function at the University of Washington. This especially
                pertains to undeclared students that are trying to identify the prerequisite courses needed for an application. Though these resources are already available online, students struggle locating all this information as it only exists on the major department website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to address this issue by creating a website that encompasses all major and minor
                prerequisite information. Not being in a major at the University of Washington can be an extremely
                stressful and confusing situation for students. In creating this website, we hope to eliminate the
                additional anxiety that is introduced to students as they try to navigate the endless UW resources. We would like to facilitate the process of locating information regarding prerequisite courses so that students feel more informed with their student career path and secure in building their schedule.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                Students, specifically underclassmen, will be visiting this application, but anyone can use the website. Minorities will benefit from the accessibility of this website just as non-minorities will. Users can use this app to view what the prerequisites and course requirements are for specific majors. Students can input which classes they have already completed, and using this information, the application will list which majors students are currently progressing towards and which classes they need to take to fulfill the curriculum requirements for each listed major.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                In regards to interactive features, students will have the ability to add which classes they’ve taken by clicking an add course button, where they can type in the course names and the matching keywords should pop up until they find the right class. Within this is another feature that helps you filter from hard classes to easy classes, giving users a possible plan when selecting their classes for the quarter. We will also include a section for students within the major to comment on their individual experiences with a posting feature. This gives students the ability to reflect on the classes they have taken, which their peers can use as advice if they plan on taking the course as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                The users will be viewing information about applying to a certain major. They will see the prerequisite they need to take (and which ones they have already completed). Our dataframe will consist of two majors to start with, specifically Informatics and Computer Science. Though we are only including two majors right now, this number can potentially grow once the site has been fully published.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem is that students coming in from high school may be very confused about the process of
                applying to a major or about going into UW as a direct admit. We will have information on the site
                describing to users how the major application process works and what it means to directly apply to a
                major. UW underclassman may also be conflicted on what major to enroll in. We will give them options to search and filter majors/minors to help them come to a decision about their future. Our app will give its users the information they need about potential majors/minors in a clear and concise format. It won’t be an “information dump” on the user. It will only show essentials to applying to the major/minor (i.e. prerequisite courses, application deadlines, resources to more in-depth information about the major). Our app will be a way for students to explore new majors. Once they know what they want their path at UW to be, they can use other preexisting sites about UW majors/minors to get more in-depth information about each department.
