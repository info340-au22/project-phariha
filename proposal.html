            <p>
                It has come to our attention that underclassmen (freshman and sophomore students) lack the general understanding of how majors and minors function at the University of Washington. This especially pertains to undeclared students that are trying to identify the prerequisite courses needed for an application. Though these resources are already available online, students struggle locating all this information as it only exists on the major department website. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to address this issue by creating a website that encompasses all major and minor prerequisite information. Not being in a major at the University of Washington can be an extremely stressful and confusing situation for students. In creating this website, we hope to eliminate the additional anxiety that is introduced to students as they try to navigate the endless UW resources. We would like to facilitate the process of locating information regarding prerequisite courses so that students feel more informed with their student career path and secure in building their schedule.
