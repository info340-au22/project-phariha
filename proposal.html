            <p>
                It has come to our attention that underclassmen (freshman and sophomore students) lack the general understanding of how majors and minors function at the University of Washington. This especially pertains to undeclared students that are trying to identify the prerequisite courses needed for an application. Though these resources are already available online, students struggle locating all this information as it only exists on the major department website. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to address this issue by creating a website that encompasses all major and minor prerequisite information. Not being in a major at the University of Washington can be an extremely stressful and confusing situation for students. In creating this website, we hope to eliminate the additional anxiety that is introduced to students as they try to navigate the endless UW resources. We would like to facilitate the process of locating information regarding prerequisite courses so that students feel more informed with their student career path and secure in building their schedule.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                The users will be viewing information about applying to a certain major/minor. They will see the prerequisite they need to take (and which ones they have already completed). We are going to create the dataframe about major/minor prereqs and other general information on our own. We will also include a section for students within the major/minor to comment on their experiences. This way,  the user can get an overall understanding of how people within a major/minor feel about it before applying. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem is that students coming in from high school may be very confused about the process of applying to a major or about going into UW as a direct admit. We will have information on the site describing to users how the major application process works and what it means to directly apply to a major. UW underclassman may also be conflicted on what major to enroll in. We will give them options to search and filter majors/minors to help them come to a decision about their future. Our app will give its users the information they need about potential majors/minors in a clear and concise format. It won’t be an “information dump” on the user. It will only show essentials to applying to the major/minor (i.e. prerequisite courses, application deadlines, resources to more in-depth information about the major/minor). Our app will be a way for students to explore new majors. Once they know what they want their path at UW to be, they can use other preexisting sites about UW majors/minors to get more in-depth information about each department.
